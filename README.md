## Introduction
In this project, we will build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system locally using a large language model (LLM). We'll leverage Hugging Face's Pipeline within Langchain and integrate it with a Hugging Face Embedding model.

### The core components of this tutorial include:
 
**Vector Storage:**
We will use ChromaDB from Langchain to store vectors. ChromaDB is an efficient vector database that allows us to perform fast similarity searches.

**Similarity Search**: 
Using Langchain to retrieve the most relevant information by performing a similarity search on the vector database.

**Information Retrieval:**
We'll retrieve the Top 2 most relevant pieces of information based on the user's query and our pre-stored vectors in the database.
Next Steps & Enhancements

This system is just the starting point to build the RAG. You can further enhance it by:

Refining the Prompt Templates: Implementing more precise prompt templates to guide the model's response.
Tuning Model Parameters: Experimenting with model parameters like temperature to control the randomness of responses.
Changing Models: Swapping out different embedding models and LLM models to explore how they impact performance.
