## Project Description (for GitHub)

**LLM with Document Retrieval System**

This project combines the power of large language models with document retrieval to create a context-aware question answering system. It uses:

1. **ChromaDB** for storing and retrieving document embeddings
2. **Run Locally**  for text generation directly using HuggingFace
3. **Gradio** for an intuitive web interface prototype

Key capabilities:
- Finds relevant documents for user queries
- Generates responses based on retrieved context
- Tracks and displays source information
- Runs efficiently on consumer hardware through quantization

Ideal for:
- Building knowledge-based assistants
- Creating document Q&A systems
- Experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation
